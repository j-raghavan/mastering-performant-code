Built-in Data Structure Analyzer

This module provides tools to analyze the memory usage and performance
characteristics of Python's built-in data structures and our implementations.

CPython Implementation References:
- Objects/listobject.c: How lists actually resize and manage memory
- Objects/dictobject.c: Combined table implementation with split storage
- Objects/setobject.c: How sets handle duplicates and memory layout
- Include/listobject.h: List object structure and macros
- Include/dictobject.h: Dict object structure and macros

The performance differences between built-ins and our implementations are expected:
- Built-in list: Implemented in C, optimized memory layout, direct array access
- Our DynamicArray: Pure Python, educational clarity over speed
- Typical ratio: 2-10x slower is normal for educational implementations
- Key insight: Understanding the tradeoffs between readability and performance
